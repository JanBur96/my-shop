# LocalShop

This is my first big web application I've created. It aims to be a bit like _eBay_ or _eBay-Kleinanzeigen_. I've used this project to improve my skills, at first it improved everything quite a lot, but it's a lot of repetition in the end.

This is basically V1 of LocalShop. It's "finished for now" but not completely finished, so I'm planning to add more functionality later, as soon as I get more experience and time. This project isn't perfect and I was the only person working on it, without any "Real-Life" experience, so it could have some bugs and mistakes, but I gave my best - I promise! :-)
